# Clipboard Trimmer

Clipboard Trimmer is a simple, lightweight Chrome extension that trims items in the clipboard and removes spaces/line breaks at the end. This extension was created by GPT4 because I got annoyed with having to remove line breaks when pasting data from Excel into textareas.

# Installation

Installation is the same as any other developer extension.

1) Save files to folder
2) Chrome Menu -> Extensions -> Manage Extensions
3) Switch "Developer Mode" to enabled.
4) Press "Load unpacked," and select the folder.
5) Test by copy and pasting a cell from Excel into any form of text editor in the browser. There should be no spaces/line breaks at the end.
